# Introduction

The 2018 NBA Playoffs has come a long way from basketball then. Stats and information of some of your favorite players are readily available via Internet connection. Audible NBA presents to you an interesting, intuitive, and comedic chatbot in which you can physically ask and receive your appropriate response.

**We aim to provide, you, the user with an enjoyable, basketball-oriented question and answer experience.**

How far can AudibleNBA go in a 5-week timespan?

 + AudibleNBA, over the course of this 5-week timespan, will be, essentially, a basketball chatbot prototype that will answer a finite (very-limited) set of questions devised by us, the developers. We, the developers, will be completely familiar with the framework and environment that we will set up in order for possible future modifications and evolution of AudibleNBA. A chatbot specializing in any topic all utilize recent/new technologies only having been readily available within the past few years; that is where the challenge lies. However, with our current knowledge of databases and the Javascript language, we will be able to construct AudibleNBA and AudibleNBA will be able to accept user voice (question) and return the specific and appropriate response.
 
Technologies:

 + Backend web framework (Node)
 + Frontend Google Assistant api.ai
 + Developer created and familiar Firebase database
